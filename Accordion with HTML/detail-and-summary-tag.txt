Accordion: 
Disclosure widget is a user interface control that hides and shows content.
the <detail> and <sumary> html tag is very useful to make a accordion.

The accordion graphical user interface is a series of vertically stacked disclosure widgets. A common use 
case for the accordion UI is the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page on many sites. An accordion FAQ 
contains a list of visible questions; clicking on a question expands, or "discloses", the answer to that 
question.


The HTML details tag is an HTML element used to create a collapsible section of content on a page. It's 
like a digital toggle switch that lets users expand or collapse additional information with a click.

Here's the syntax of the details tag:

<details>
    <summary>Summary Text</summary>
    <!-- hidden content -->
</details>
<details> is the main container element. It encapsulates the content you want to make expandable and 
collapsible.

Next, <summary> is placed inside <details> as the first child element. The <summary> serves as the title or 
heading for the collapsible section and is visible when the page loads. When users click on it, the hidden 
content inside <details> is revealed. When <summary> is clicked again, the content is hidden.

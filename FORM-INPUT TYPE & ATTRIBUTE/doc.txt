HTML Form
An HTML Form is a section of the document that collects input from the user. The input from the user is 
generally sent to a server (Web servers, Mail clients, etc).
We use the HTML <form> element to create forms in HTML.


HTML input Tag:
The HTML input Tag is the place where a user can enter data. The input tag is used within < form> element 
to declare input controls that allow users to input data. The default value accepted by the <input> Tag is 
text.
An input field can be of various types depending upon the attribute type. The Input tag is an empty element 
that only contains attributes. For defining labels for the input element, < label> can be used.

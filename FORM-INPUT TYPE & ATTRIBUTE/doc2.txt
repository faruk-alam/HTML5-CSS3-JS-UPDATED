HTML input Tag:

The input type text is used to create single-line text fields. It is the default input type.

<label for="name">Search: </label>
<input type="text" id="name">

2. Input Type button
The input type button is used to create a button with no default functionality.
For example,

<input type="button" value="Click Me!">

3. Input Type checkbox
The input type checkbox is used to create a checkbox input. 
For example :

<input type="checkbox" id="subscribe" value="subscribe">
<label for="subscribe">Subscribe to newsletter!</label><br>

The checkbox can be toggled between selected and not selected.
The value of the checkbox is included in the form data only if the checkbox is selected and is omitted if 
the checkbox is not selected.

4. Input Type color
The input type color is used to create an input field that lets the user pick a color. 
For example :

<input type="color" id="background">
<label for="background">Background Color</label>

The color picker is inbuilt into the browser. Users can also manually enter the hex code of the color 
instead. The UI for the color picker differs from browser to browser.

5. Input Type date
The input type date is used to create an input field that lets the user input a date using the date picker 
interface from the browser. 
For example :

<label for="birthday">Birthday:</label>
<input type="date" id="birthday">

6. Input Type datetime-local
The input type datetime-local is used to create an input field that lets the user pick a date and time using 
a date-time-picker from the browser. The time selected from the input does not include information about the 
timezone. 
For example :

<label for="meeting-time">Choose a time for your appointment:</label>
<input type="datetime-local" id="meeting-time" >

7. Input Type email
The input type email is used to create an input field that allows the user to input a valid email address.

<label for="email">Enter your email:</label>
<input type="email" id="email">

Note: This input field throws an error if the value provided is not a valid email. 

8. Input Type file
The input type file is used to create an input field that lets the user upload a file or multiple files 
from their device. 
For example :

<input type="file" name="file">

9. Input Type hidden
The input type hidden is used to create an invisible input field. This is used to supply additional value to 
the server from the form that cannot be seen or modified by the user. 
For example :
<input type="hidden" name="id" value="123" >

10. Input Type image
The input type image is used to create a button using an image.

<input type="image" src="/submit.png" alt="submit" >

11. Input Type month
The input type month is used to create an input field that lets the user enter month and year using a visual 
interface from the browser. 
For example :

<label for="start">Select Month:</label>
<input type="month" id="start" >

12. Input Type password
The input type password is used to create an input field that lets the user enter information securely. 
For example :

<label for="password">Password:</label>
<input type="password" id="password">
The browser displays all the characters the user types using an asterisk (*).

13. Input Type radio
The input type radio is used to define a radio button. Radio buttons are defined in a group. Radio buttons 
let users pick one option out of a group of options.

<form>
  <input type="radio" id="cat" name="animal" value="cat">
  <label for="cat">cat</label>
  <input type="radio" id="dog" name="animal" value="dog">
  <label for="dog">dog</label>
 </form>
From the above example, we can see that all the radio buttons share the same name attribute. It allows the 
user to select exactly one option from the group of radio buttons.
When submitting the form data, the key for the input will be the name attribute, and the value will be the 
radio button selected.
Note: The name attribute is used as the key for the data when submitting the form.

14. Input Type range
The input type range is used to create a range picker from which the user can select the value. User can select a value from the range given. It has a default range from 0 to 100. For example,

<label for="range">Select value: </label>
<input type="range" id="range" value="90">

15. Input Type reset
The input type reset defines the button which clears all the form values to their default value. 
For example :

<form>
   <label for="name">Name:</label>
   <input id="name" type="text"  /><br />
   <input type="reset" value="Reset" />
 </form>

16. Input Type search
The input type search allows user to enter their search queries in the text fields. It is similar to input 
type text. 
For example,

<label for="search">Search: </label><input type="search" id="search" >
Note: The search input does not work as a search unless we use some JavaScript to do the search calculation.

17. Input Type submit
The input type submit is used when the user submits the form to the server. It is rendered as a button. 
For example :

<input type="submit" value="submit">
Here, The text provided in the value attribute of the input is shown in the button.

The pattern in the above example allows numbers in the format XXX-XX-XXX where X is a number between 0 and 9.

19. Input Type time
The input type time attribute creates an input field that accepts time value. It allows users to add time in
hours, minutes, and seconds easily. 
For example :

<label for="time">Select Time:</label>
<input type="time" id="time">

20. Input Type url
The input type url is used to let the user enter and edit a URL. 
For example :

<label for="url">URL:</label>
<input type="url" id="url" placeholder="https://example.com" pattern="https://.*">
Here, placeholder is a hint that specifies the expected value of an input field, and the pattern defines 
what type of value is accepted. The above pattern means that only text beginning with https:// will be valid.

21. Input Type week
The input type week lets the user pick a week and a year from a calendar. 
For example :

<label for="week">Week</label>
<input type="week" id="week" >

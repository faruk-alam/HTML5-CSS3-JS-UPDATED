HTML attributes are data that can be added to the opening tag of an HTML element. Attributes are 
space-separated names and name/value pairs appearing in the opening tag, providing information 
about and functionality for the element.
These attributes modify the default behavior of the element or provide additional information about it.

Attributes consist of a name and are usually set equal to a value. Values are enclosed in double or single 
quotation marks.

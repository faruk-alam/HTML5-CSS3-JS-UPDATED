                                  Basic tags of HTML

HTML Paragraphs :
The HTML <p> tag is used to create paragraphs. 

For example -
<p>HTML is fun to learn.</p>

HTML paragraphs always start on a new line. To demonstrate this, 
let's create a webpage with two paragraphs - 

<p>Paragraph 1: Short Paragraph</p>
<p>Paragraph 2: Long Paragraph, this is a long paragraph with more text to 
fill an entire line in the website.</p>

The above HTML code contains two paragraphs. And each paragraph starts on a new line even though there is 
sufficient space after the first paragraph.

Note: By default, browsers automatically add whitespace (margin) above and below paragraphs. 
It is possible to change whitespace and other design aspects using CSS.

HTML Headings
The HTML heading tags (<h1> to <h6>) are used to add headings to a webpage. 

For example :
<h1>This is heading 1.</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2.</h2>
<h3>This is heading 3.</h3>
<h4>This is heading 4.</h4>
<h5>This is heading 5.</h5>
<h6>This is heading 6.</h6>

In the example, 
we have used tags <h1> to <h6> to create headings of varying sizes and importance.

The <h1> tag denotes the most important heading on a webpage. Similarly, <h6> denotes the least important 
heading.
The difference in sizes of heading tags comes from the browser's default styling. And, you can always change
the styling of heading tags, including font size, using CSS.

Note: Do not use heading tags to create large texts. It's because search engines like Google use heading 
tags to understand what a page is about.

HTML Comments
HTML comments are used to insert notes to a web page. For example,

<!-- heading 2 -->
<h2>Comments in HTML</h2>
Here, <!-- heading 2 --> is a comment. In HTML, comments start with <!-- and ends with -->

HTML comments are not displayed by browsers. They are used to add notes for documentation purposes within code. 
For example -

<!-- an HTML div  -->
<div>
    <p>HTML is fun to learn.</p>
</div>

Why use HTML Comments?
Comments are mainly used to make our code more readable. They are completely hidden from the webpage and only 
show up in the code.
Commenting on your code is a good practice as it helps us to express what the code is doing. It can act as an 
anchor for you if you want to change your code in the future.

In a collaborative environment, code comments are helpful for other developers as well.

Note: Even though browsers don't display comments, it's still possible to view comments using the browser's 
View Source feature. That's why we must not add sensitive information inside comments.

Single-Line and Multi-line Comments
In HTML, we use the same syntax to create single-line and multi-line comments.

Single Line Comment

<!-- Write a heading -->
<h1>Important Heading</h1>
Multi-line Comments

 <!-- Multiple Line comments 
 can include line breaks 
 and also extra     spaces -->
  
 <p>this will display in the webpage</p>

 HTML Tags Inside Comments
If we put HTML elements inside comments, they will be ignored. For example,

  <p>this will be displayed</p>

  <!-- <p>this will not be displayed</p> -->

  <p>this will also be displayed</p>


HTML Table 
The HTML table tag (<table>) is used to represent data in a structured way by creating a table. 
For example :

<table border="1" >
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Age</th>  
    <th>Country</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Harry Depp</td>
    <td>28</td>
    <td>Britain</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John Smith</td>
    <td>35</td>
    <td>USA</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ram Krishna</td>
    <td>19</td>
    <td>Nepal</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the above example, you can see we have used multiple tags to create a table in HTML.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
<th>

Table tag <table> in HTML
The <table> tag is used to define a table. For example,

<table>
  â€¦.
<table>

Table Row <tr> in HTML
The <tr> tag is used to define a row in a table. For example,

<table>
<tr>
  ...
</tr>
</table>

Table Row <tr> in HTML
The <tr> tag is used to define a row in a table. For example,

<table>
<tr>
  ...
</tr>
</table>

The table row can include either table heading, <th> or table data, <td>.

<tr>
  <th>Name</th>
  <th>Country</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Prasanna</td>
  <td>Nepal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Simon</td>
  <td>USA</td>
</tr>
In a table, there can be any number of rows.

Table Heading, <th> in HTML
The <th> tag is used to define a table header. It is generally the top row of the table. 
For example :

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mango</td>
    <td>125</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Orange</td>
    <td>75</td>
  </tr>
</table>

In the above example, Item and Count are table headers and they are used to represent the category of data in 
a particular row.

Here, the styling of the table headers is bold and center-aligned. This is because the <th> tag has some 
default styling.

Table Cell <td> in HTML
The <td> tag is used to define table cells (data). The table cells store data to be displayed in the table. 
For example :

<tr>
  <td>Apple</td>
  <td>Mango</td>
  <td>Orange</td>
</tr>
In the above example, <td>Apple</td>, <td>Mango</td> and <td>Orange</td> are table cells.

Table cells are generally inside the table row or table headers.

Table Border
Remember we have used the border attribute in our first example.

<table border="1">
  ...
</table>
In HTML, the border attribute is used to add a border to a table and all the cells.

Note: We can have borders of various styles in tables, however for more specific borders, we need to use CSS.

To prevent double borders like the one in the example above, we can set the border-collapse property of the 
table. 
For example :

<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;">
  ...
</table>


The HTML table can be divided into three parts: a header, a body, and a footer.

1. Table Header

We use the <thead> tag to add a table head. The <thead> tag must come before any other tags inside a table. 
For example -

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
        <th>Head1</th>
        <th>Head2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  ...
  ...
</table>
The content of <thead> is placed on the top part of the table and we usually place the rows with table 
headers inside the <thead> tag.

2. Table Body

We use the <tbody> tag to add a table body. The <tbody> tag must come after <thead> and before any other tags 
inside a table. For example,

<table>
  <thead>
    ...
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Cell 1</td>
      <td>Cell 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

  ...
  ...
</table>
The content of <tbody> is placed on the center part of the table and we usually place the rows with the 
content we want to represent in the <tbody>.

3. Table Footer

We use the <tfoot> tag to add a table footer. The <tfoot> tag must come after <tbody> and before any other 
tags inside a table. For example,

<table>
  <thead>
    ...
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    ,,,,
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td>foot 1</td>
      <td>foot 2</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>
The content of <tbody> is placed on the bottom part of the table and we usually place the rows with the footer in the <tfoot>.

All these tags must be placed inside a <table> tag and must contain at least one <tr>. 
For example :
                                HTML Table Head, Body, and Footer

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>S.N</th>
      <th>Item</th>
      <th>Quantity</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Apple</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Mango</td>
      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>Orange</td>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td>Total</td>
      <td>5</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
</table>

Colspan and Rowspan

Colspan
The colspan attribute merges cells across multiple columns. 
For example :

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>S.N</th>
    <th>Item</th>
    <th>Quantity</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>Apple</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td>
    <td>Mango</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>3</td>
    <td>Orange</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Total</td>
    <td>5</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the above example, you can see that the last row only has 2 cells with one cell occupying 2 columns.

The value of the colspan attribute determines how many columns the cell occupies.

Rowspan
The rowspan attribute merges cells across multiple rows. 
For example -

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Subject</th>
    <th>Marks</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="3">Mark Smith</td>
    <td>English</td>
    <td>67</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Maths</td>
    <td>82</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Science</td>
    <td>91</td>
  </tr>
</table>
In the above example, you can see that the first column only has 2 cells with one cell occupying 2 rows.
The value of the rowspan attribute determines how many rows the cell occupies.

FAQ about HTML Table :

Can we use both colspan and rowspan together?
Yes, we can use both colspan and rowspan to create cells that occupy multiple rows and columns.

How to create vertical headers on table ?

Before,we have seen table headers, <th>, used in the top row multiple times. But we can also add the <th> tags across columns to create a vertical header. For example,

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Sam</td>
    <td>Steve</td>
    <td>Peggy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <td>31</td>
    <td>42</td>
    <td>29</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Gender</th>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

How to add caption in HTML table ?

Caption in HTML TABLE
The <caption> element acts as the title of the table. It is used to give a short description of the table. 
It shows up on top of the table.

The <caption> tag must be the first child of the <table> element.

<table>
  <caption>Employee Details</caption>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <td>Sam</td>
    <td>Steve</td>
    <td>Peggy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Age</th>
    <td>31</td>
    <td>42</td>
    <td>29</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <th>Gender</th>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>M</td>
    <td>F</td>
  </tr>
</table>

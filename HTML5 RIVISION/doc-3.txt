                                        HTML Lists
HTML lists are used to display related information in an easy-to-read and concise way as lists.
   
We can use three types of lists to represent different types of data in HTML:

Unordered List <ul>
Ordered List <ol>
Description List <d

Unordered List
The unordered list is used to represent data in a list for which the order of does not matter.
We can use an unordered list for keeping track of groceries, supplies and random objects

In HTML, we use the <ul> tag to create unordered lists. Each item of the list must be a <li> tag which 
represents list items. For example,

<ul>
  <li>Apple</li>
  <li>Orange</li>
  <li>Mango</li>
</ul>

Here, <li>Apple</li>, <li>Orange</li>, and <li>Mango</li> are the list items.

Unordered Lists Marker
We use the CSS list-style-type property to change the marker that marks the list item. The valid options for 
markers are -

Icon	               Marker	           Description
• (default)	           disc	          sets the marker to a dot
○	                   circle	      sets the marker to a hollow circle
▪	                   square	      sets the marker to a filled black square
	                   none           removes the marker altogether


Nesting Lists of Unordered list :
In HTML, we can create a nested list by adding one list inside another. 
For example :

 <ul>    
    <li>
      Coffee
      <ul>
        <li>Cappuccino</li>
        <li>Americano</li>
        <li>Espresso</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Tea
      <ul>
        <li>Milk Tea</li>
        <li>Black Tea</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Milk</li>
  </ul>

In the above example, you can see we have added unordered lists inside another unordered list.
In this case, the first and second list items of the outer unordered list include unordered lists.

Ordered List :
The ordered list is used to represent data in a list for which the order of items has significance.
We can use the HTML ordered list for recipes, algorithms, top ten lists, and so on.

The <ol> tag is used to create ordered lists. Similar to unordered lists, each item in the ordered list must 
be a <li> tag. 
For example :

<ol>
  <li>Ready</li>
  <li>Set</li>
  <li>Go</li>
</ol>

Each item of the list is enclosed inside the <li> tag and they are numbered by decimal numbers.
By default, ordered lists are ordered by numbers, however, we can change them as per our choice.

Ordered Lists Type
We use the type attribute to change the marker for the list. There are five types of numbering in the 
ordered list. They are

Type	                          Description
"1"(Default) 	         The list is numbered with numbers.
"a"	                     The list is numbered with lower-case alphabets.
"A"	                     The list is numbered with upper-case alphabets.
"i"	                     The list is numbered with lower-case roman numerals.
"I"	                     The list is numbered with upper-case roman numerals.

start Attribute
We use the start attribute to change the starting point for the numbering of the list. 
For example :

  <ol start='5'>
    <li>Harry</li>
    <li>Ron</li>
    <li>Sam</li>
  </ol>
  Here, we change the starting value of the list to 5.
  This attribute also works with other types. For example,

  <ol type="a" start='5'>
    <li>Harry</li>
    <li>Ron</li>
    <li>Sam</li>
  </ol>
  Similarly, we can use the start attribute along with all other types.

reversed Attribute
We can use the reversed attribute on the ordered list to reverse the numbering on the list. 
For example :

  <ol reversed>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Fish</li>
  </ol>

  Nesting Lists
In HTML, we can create a nested list by adding one list inside another. 
For example :

<ol type="I">
  <li>
    Chapter 1
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
      <li>Lesson 2</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapter 2
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
      <li>Lesson 2</li>
      <li>Lesson 3</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapter 3
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>




HTML Ordered List
We use the HTML ordered list to define a list where the sequence or order of the list items is important. We can use the HTML ordered list for recipes, algorithms, top ten lists, and so on.

We use the <ol> tag to create an unordered list. For example,

<ol>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Address</li>
  <li>Phone Number</li>
</ol>

An HTML ordered list
Each item of the list is enclosed inside the <li> tag and they are numbered by decimal numbers.

By default, ordered lists are ordered by numbers, however, we can change them as per our choice.

Ordered Lists Type
We use the type attribute to change the marker for the list. There are five types of numbering in the ordered list. They are

Type	Description
"1"(Default) 	The list is numbered with numbers.
"a"	The list is numbered with lower-case alphabets.
"A"	The list is numbered with upper-case alphabets.
"i"	The list is numbered with lower-case roman numerals.
"I"	The list is numbered with upper-case roman numerals.
Below, we can see examples for all the number types.

HTML ordered list with 5 types of markers.
start Attribute
We use the start attribute to change the starting point for the numbering of the list. For example,

  <ol start='5'>
    <li>Harry</li>
    <li>Ron</li>
    <li>Sam</li>
  </ol>
Browser Output

An HTML ordered list starting at number 5
Here, we change the starting value of the list to 5.


This attribute also works with other types. For example,

  <ol type="a" start='5'>
    <li>Harry</li>
    <li>Ron</li>
    <li>Sam</li>
  </ol>
Browser Output

An HTML ordered list starting at e 
Similarly, we can use the start attribute along with all other types.

reversed Attribute
We can use the reversed attribute on the ordered list to reverse the numbering on the list. For example,

  <ol reversed>
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Fish</li>
  </ol>
Browser Output

An HTML ordered list with reversed order
Here, we can see the order of the list is reversed, the first list item is numbered 4 and the last is numbered 1.

Similarly, the reversed attribute can also be used with other types and in conjunction with the start attribute. For example,

 <ol reversed type="I" start="10">
    <li>Cat</li>
    <li>Dog</li>
    <li>Elephant</li>
    <li>Fish</li>
</ol>
Browser Output

An HTML ordered list with reversed order starting at 'X'
In the above example, we use the upper-case roman numeral type and start at 10 and reverse the order of the numbers.

Nesting Lists
In HTML, we can create a nested list by adding one list inside another. For example,

<ol type="I">
  <li>
    Chapter 1
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
      <li>Lesson 2</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapter 2
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
      <li>Lesson 2</li>
      <li>Lesson 3</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Chapter 3
    <ol type="a">
      <li>Lesson 1</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
Browser Output

HTML ordered lists nested inside another ordered list
In the above example, you can see we have added an ordered list inside another ordered list.

In this case, the list item of the outer ordered list also includes an ordered list.

Similarly, we can also mix list types while nesting and add an unordered list inside the 
ordered list. 
For example :

<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare the ingredients.
    <ul>
      <li>Eggs</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Mix the ingredients and cook on a low flame. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Serve hot with garnish. You can use
    <ul>
      <li>Chives</li>
      <li>Bacon</li>
      <li>Coriander</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

Note: In our examples, we are nesting the list up to a single level, however, we can also nest lists up to 
multiple levels.

HTML Description List
We use the HTML description list to create a list where list items include terms and descriptions of the term.

In HTML, we use the <dl> tag to create a description list. For example,

<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
</dl>

Here, you can see two different types of list items:

<dt>(dt = description title) - defines the terms/name
<dd>(dd = discription data) - defines the description/value of the term/name
You can see the description list includes two related values, hence it can also be used to store items 
in key/value pairs.

Since the description list includes the definition of a term, it is also known as the definition list.

                                        HTML Image

The HTML <img> tag embeds an image within the HTML web page. 
For example :
<img src="logo.png">
Here, the <img> tag inserts the image logo.png on the webpage.
Note: The <img> tag is an empty tag, i.e. It doesn't require a closing tag.             

The HTML image tag has 2 important attributes:

The src attribute
The alt attribute

HTML Image src Attribute
The src attribute is a required attribute for the <img> tag. It specifies the path (URL) to the image. 
aIt tells the browser where to look for the image. 
For example :

<img src="tictactoe.png" >

In the above example, the src attribute tells the browser to load the image from the same directory where 
the webpage is located.

Similarly, if the image is stored in a subdirectory, the path in the src attribute would be written as

<img src="images/tictactoe.png" >
If the image is located on another server entirely or if we want to use an image from the web, we can 
provide an absolute URL for the image. 
For example :

<img src="https://www.example.com/images/tictactoe.png">

Note: Although we can provide an absolute path for images located in our own web server, better to 
provide a relative path as it leads to faster loading times. Hence always use relative paths for images 
in your own server.

HTML Image alt Attribute
The alt attribute is the text description of an image. The value of the alt attribute should describe the 
image such that the content is meaningful even if the image fails to load.

<img src="computer.png" alt=" A standard Computer" >

The alt attribute's contents are shown if the user cannot view the image (slow internet, wrong src attribute, 
or using a screen reader).

It also helps in SEO as it helps the search engine understand what images are about.

HTML Image title Attribute
The title attribute displays the information about the image when the user hovers over the image. 
For example :

<img src="tictactoe.png" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" title="Tic-Tac-Toe" />

Note: Although alt and title attributes appear similar, the title attribute cannot be used as an alternative 
to the alt attribute. The title is not read by screen readers and does not display when the image fails to 
load.

HTML Image Size - Width and Height
We can use the style attribute to specify the height and width of an Image. 

For example :
<img src="tictactoe.jpg" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">

Alternatively, we can also use the height and width attributes to set the height and width. 

For example :
<img src="tictactoe.jpg" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" width="200" height="200">

HTML Bold
We use the HTML <b> tag or the HTML <strong> tag to make text bold. 

For example:

<b>This text is bold.</b>
<br>
<strong>This text is

HTML <b> vs <strong> Tag :
Both <b> and <strong> tags make the text inside them bold and there is no difference in how browsers render 
these tags.
However, the <strong> tag is a semantic tag that indicates the text content is of strong importance, 
seriousness, or urgency (for example, Warning! Falling rocks) whereas the <b> tag has no semantic meaning 
and only makes the text bold.
Hence, it is generally preferred to use the HTML <strong> tag.
Note: You can also use the CSS property font-weight to make the text bold.

HTML Italic
We use the HTML <i> tag or the HTML <em> tag to make the text italic.

HTML <i> Tag
The HTML <i> tag is a physical tag used to make the text italic. It is used to indicate foreign text, 
scientific nomenclature, thoughts, etc.

<p> This text is <i>italic</i>.</p>

HTML <em> Tag
The HTML <em> tag is a semantic tag that is used to signify that the text inside the tag is being emphasized.
It is a semantic tag as opposed to <i> which doesn't hold any semantic meaning.

<p> This text is <em>emphasized</em>.</p>

Usage of HTML <i> tag
The <i> tag is a presentational tag, it is mostly used to:

Usage of HTML <i> tag
The <i> tag is a presentational tag, it is mostly used to:

1. represent text in another language. 
For example :
<p> The Foreigner said <i>Bonjour cher ami </i>, which means 'Hello dear friend' in French. </p>

2. represent words or phrases used as terms. 
For example :
<p> The words <i>the</i>, <i>a</i> and <i>an</i> are articles. </p>
<p> This is an example of an <i>idiom.</i> </p>

3. represent scientific names of animals, plants, etc. 
For example :
<p> The scientific name for cow is <i>Bos indicus.</i></p>


HTML <em> Tag Vs HTML <i> Tag
There is no difference in how <i> and <em> tag renders on the browser. 
For example :

<p>Do not enter the tiger enclosure <i>under any circumstances</i>.</p>
<p>My teachers <em>heavily</em> emphasize studying.</p>

Both <em> and <i> make the font italic. However, <em> tag is a semantic tag that indicates that the text 
inside the tag is spoken with a stressed emphasis when compared to surrounding texts. Screen Readers will 
also emphasize text inside the <em> tag. Whereas the <i> tag only make the text italic.

Note: For purely styling purposes, it is recommended to use the CSS property font-style.

HTML Superscript and Subscript
Superscript
The HTML <sup> tag is used to create superscript text. The text inside the <sup> tag is rendered half a 
character above the normal line and has a smaller font size. 

For example :
<p> This is a <sup>Superscript</sup> text.</p>

Usage of Superscript
Superscript text is generally used for exponents, measurement units, and ordinal numbers. 
For example :

1. Superscript in exponents
<p> a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2<sup></p>

2. Superscript in measurement units
<p>The area of this park is 200m<sup>2</sup>.</p>

3. Superscript in ordinal numbers
<p>Ram scored 1<sup>st</sup> position in the 100m race.</p>

Subscript
The HTML <sub> tag is used to create subscript text. The text inside the <sub> tag is rendered half a 
character below the normal line and has a smaller font size. 
For example,
<p> This is a <sub>Subscript</sub> text.</p>

Usage of Subscript
Superscript text is generally used for mathematics and chemical formulas. 
For example :

1. Usage in Mathematical Formula
<p> <var>x<sub>1</sub></var> â€¦ <var>x<sub>n</sub></var></p>

2. Usage in Chemical Formula
<p> H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> is chemical formula for sulphuric acid.</p>

HTML Quotation
The HTML quotation elements are used to insert the quoted text in the web page that is different from the 
standard text on the website.

<q>
<blockquote>

<q> tag
The <q> tag is used for short quotations that do not require paragraph breaks. 
For example :

<p>This is a paragraph with <q>quotation text</q></p>

<blockquote> tag :
The <blockquote> tag defines the section of text that is quoted from another source. Another source is any 
place other than the current website. It is used to represent block of quoted text. 

For example :
<blockquote cite="https://www.programiz.com/about-us"> Our mission is to help users learn programming more 
easily.</blockquote>
<p>-Programiz.com</p>

In the above example, the <blockquote> tag displays the quoted text as a block with an indentation at the 
beginning that indicates that it is a quotation.

The cite attribute is an optional attribute used to add a URL that designates a source document for the 
information quoted. In this example, we can see that the above quote is quoted from the Programiz site.

HTML Iframes
The HTML <iframe> tag is used to embed a webpage within a webpage. It is also called an inline frame. 
For example :
<iframe src="https://programiz.pro" title="programiz pro website" height="500" width="500" ></iframe>

Here,
src: It is used to specify the URL of the website to be loaded.
title: It is good practice to include a title attribute so that screen readers can read the title to users.

Other Attributes for <iframe>
There are some importat attributes for <iframe>. They are:

height and width
name
srcdoc
We will explore each of them in detail.

height and width
We can set the height and width of the <iframe> element with the height or width attribute. 
For example :
<iframe src="https://programiz.pro" height="200" width="300"></iframe>

We can also use CSS to set the width and height of the <iframe> using the style attribute. 
For example:
<iframe src="https://programiz.pro" style="height:200px;width:300px"></iframe>
It is important to add height and width to allocate space on the webpage for the iframe.It prevents content 
from moving when the iframe loads.

name
The name attribute is used to specify the name for an iframe. It can be used as a target for other HTML 
elements like the <a> tag. 

For example,
<iframe src="https://parewalabs.com" name="iframe_target" height="500" width="400"></iframe>

<a href="https://www.programiz.pro" target="iframe_target">Switch to Programiz Pro</a>

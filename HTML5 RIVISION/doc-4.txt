                                        HTML Image

The HTML <img> tag embeds an image within the HTML web page. 
For example :
<img src="logo.png">
Here, the <img> tag inserts the image logo.png on the webpage.
Note: The <img> tag is an empty tag, i.e. It doesn't require a closing tag.             

The HTML image tag has 2 important attributes:

The src attribute
The alt attribute

HTML Image src Attribute
The src attribute is a required attribute for the <img> tag. It specifies the path (URL) to the image. 
Ã¹It tells the browser where to look for the image. 
For example :

<img src="tictactoe.png" >

In the above example, the src attribute tells the browser to load the image from the same directory where 
the webpage is located.

Similarly, if the image is stored in a subdirectory, the path in the src attribute would be written as

<img src="images/tictactoe.png" >
If the image is located on another server entirely or if we want to use an image from the web, we can 
provide an absolute URL for the image. 
For example :

<img src="https://www.example.com/images/tictactoe.png">

Note: Although we can provide an absolute path for images located in our own web server, better to 
provide a relative path as it leads to faster loading times. Hence always use relative paths for images 
in your own server.

HTML Image alt Attribute
The alt attribute is the text description of an image. The value of the alt attribute should describe the 
image such that the content is meaningful even if the image fails to load.

<img src="computer.png" alt=" A standard Computer" >

The alt attribute's contents are shown if the user cannot view the image (slow internet, wrong src attribute, 
or using a screen reader).

It also helps in SEO as it helps the search engine understand what images are about.

HTML Image title Attribute
The title attribute displays the information about the image when the user hovers over the image. 
For example :

<img src="tictactoe.png" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" title="Tic-Tac-Toe" />

Note: Although alt and title attributes appear similar, the title attribute cannot be used as an alternative 
to the alt attribute. The title is not read by screen readers and does not display when the image fails to 
load.

HTML Image Size - Width and Height
We can use the style attribute to specify the height and width of an Image. 

For example :
<img src="tictactoe.jpg" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">

Alternatively, we can also use the height and width attributes to set the height and width. 

For example :
<img src="tictactoe.jpg" alt="A game of tic-tac-toe" width="200" height="200">

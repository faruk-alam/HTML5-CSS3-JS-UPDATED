HTML Entities
The HTML entities are used to display reserved characters (characters that are used in HTML code), 
special characters, or invisible characters. 
For example :
<p>This is a &lt;p&gt; tag.</p>
Here, &lt; and &gt; are the HTML entities used to display < and > respectively.

If we were to use the <p> tag instead of &lt;p&gt; the browser would read it as a tag. Hence to display <p> 
we need to use &lt; and &gt; instead of < and > respectively.

HTML Entities Syntax
HTML entities are represented by either their name or their number.

Entity names
We use &entity_name; to add reserved characters using Entity names. 
For example :
&cent; would be displayed as ¬¢

Entity number
We use &#entity_number; to add reserved characters using Entity number. For example, &#162; would also be 
displayed as ¬¢

All entity names and numbers start with an & and end with an ;.

Note: Not all entities have names, only characters that are commonly used have entity names.

Special Characters :
Special characters are characters that are not available on a general keyboard like ¬Æ, ¬©, ¬¢, etc.
We use HTML entities to add special characters to HTML documents. 
For example :

<footer> &copy; 2022 Programiz. All rights reserved. </footer>

HTML Emojis
Emoji are small graphical images that are used to represent emotions, objects, and ideas. They can be 
inserted into HTML documents by using character code. 
For example :
<p>&#128512;</p>

Here, &#128512; is the character code for the above emoji.
Ways To Insert Emojis In Html
There are three ways to insert emojis into an HTML document. They are:

Hexadecimal code
Decimal code
Copy and paste from external sources

Hexadecimal code
We can add emojis to an HTML document by using their hexadecimal code. These code starts with &#x and ends 
with ; to specify browser that these are hexadecimal codes. 
For example :

<p>HTML is <span>&#x1F499;</span> </p>
Note: Hexadecimal code provides portability and consistency to the document in the long run.

Decimal Code
We can add Emojis to an HTML document by using their decimal code within the required tag. These codes start 
with &# and end with an ; to inform the browser that the character represented by the decimal code has been 
displayed. 
For example :

<p>&#128512;</p>

Copy and paste from external sources
We can add emojis in an HTML document by copying it from some external sources and pasting it into code. 
For example :

<p>HTML is <span> üíú </span> </p>

Some Popular Emojis
Emoji	Name	Code
üòÇ	Face with Tears of Joy	&#128514;
‚ù§	Black Heart	&#10084;
üòç	Smiling Face with Heart-Shaped Eyes	&#128525;
üôè	Person with Hands Folded	&#128591;
ü§£	Rolling On The Floor Laughing	&#129315;
üíï	Two Hearts	&#128149;
üò≠	Loudly Crying Face	&#128557;
üî•	Fire	&#128293;
üòò	Face Throwing a Kiss	&#128536;
üëç	Thumbs Up	&#128077;


HTML NBSP
HTML &nbsp; is an HTML entity for non-breaking space. It prevents two words from being rendered at 
different lines. 
For example :

<p>
    The World population as of 2022 has reached 7.837&nbsp;billion.
</p>
Here, 7.837 and billion will render on the same line on all screen sizes.

Example of &NBSP;
We use &nbsp; when we need two words together without breaking the line.
For example :

<p style="font-size: 30px">
     The World population as of 2022 has reached 7.837 billion.
</p>
Here, you can see, even on the same screen size, 7.837 and billion now stick together.

&nbsp for extra space
In HTML, multiple consecutive space characters are not treated as multiple spaces. Instead, they are 
treated as a single space. . 
For example

<p >This is a long                        paragraph.<p>

So, to add more than one space, we can use the &nbsp; entity. 
For example :
<p >This is a long &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paragraph.</p>


SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is used to create 2D diagrams such as shapes, logos, charts, etc.

The HTML <svg> tag is used to embed SVG graphics in a web page. For example,

<svg width="100" height="100" style="border:1px solid black;">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="30" fill="blue" />
</svg>
Browser Output

In the above example, the code creates an SVG element with a width of 100 pixels and a height of 100 pixels.
The SVG element has a solid black border.

Inside the <svg> element we have created a circle using <circle> element. The cx and cy attributes define 
the x and y coordinates of the center of the circle, while the r attribute defines the radius. The fill 
attribute determines the color of the circle, which is set to blue in this example.

Together, these elements create a blue circle with a black border that is centered within the <svg> 
container.

Attributes of SVG
There are various attributes of SVG. They are as follows:

preserveAspectRatio
viewport and viewBox

preserveAspectRatio
The preserveAspectRatio attribute is used in SVG elements to specify how an element should be scaled and 
aligned within the viewport. This attribute determines how the aspect ratio (ratio of width to height) of 
the element is preserved when the element is resized or stretched. For example,

<svg width="100" height="150" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="none" style="border: 1px solid 
black">
    <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />
</svg>

In this example, the preserveAspectRatio attribute is set to none, so the circle will be stretched to fit 
the dimensions of the viewport. As a result, the circle appears distorted. Let's look at another example.

<svg width="100" height="150" viewBox="0 0 100 100" preserveAspectRatio="meet" style="border: 1px solid 
black">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="50" />
</svg>

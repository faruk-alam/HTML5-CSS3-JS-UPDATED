                                        Semantic Tags
The tags which accurately describe their purpose and describe the type of their content are called semantic 
tags. 
For example :

<h1>Header</h1>
From the above code, we can accurately tell that the content inside the <h1> tag is a heading.

Some examples of semantic tags are 一 <h1>-<h6>, <form>, <table>, <main>, etc

Why use semantic HTML?
We use semantic HTML because the semantic HTML makes:

makes the code easier to read
makes the site more accessible
leads to better SEO

we’ll touch on all of the new tags added as part of HTML5 to define the structure and content of a web page :

header
main

article
section

"Clean code reads like well-written prose.Clean code never obscures the designe's intent but rather is full
of crisp abstraction and straightforward lines of control." - Robert C. Martin 
                                                    
                                        Coding Convention

Coding Convention is important part of any programming language.It is style guidelines for programming.

Typecally cover - 
Rules and Naming declaration variable and function.
Rules for use of whitespace,indention and comment as well as best coding practice.

Coding Convention secure quality,improve readability, make code mentainance easily. 

Some rules are below :

Magic Number - is a number is assigned but has no clear meaning. ln this case, this number should be stored 
to a meaningfull variable. 

Deep Nesting - is a situation when a code contains nested loop or conditional statement.In this case,Each
loop or conditional statement should be extracted into diferent function .

Stop writting comment - comment can be good,our code should be self-documented.Code must speak for itself.


Avoid large function - If any function is large in size,It is better make different function to separate the 
logic.

Less code repetition - try less code repetition

Naming variable and function - camelCase and use meaningfull Name
camelCase - every fisrt letter of first word is lowercase and every first letter of next word is Uppercase.
For example :
const camelCase = "my variable";
function homeTask (){
     // code to be here
}
camelCase is naming standard to use for indentifying name,for example variable and function.
Another important rule is to use meaningfull name when declare a variable and function name.

For example :
const listItem;
let randomNumber;
function getUserData;
const retrieveValue = (data){
    // code to be here
}

Favor descriptive over concise 

Make booleans that read well in if - than statements.

use noun for class names with pascal Case.
pascal case - the fisrt letter of the words are Uppercase
Ex :
let PascalCase = {
    // code.......
}

Capitalize constant value with SNAKE UPPER CASE (in case of multiple word)

ex - 
const PI = 3.14 ;
const SECOND_IN_A_DAY = 86400 ;

Avoid one letter variable or function name 
ex - 
const p = {};
instead of 
const person = {}

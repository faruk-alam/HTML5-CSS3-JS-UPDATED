Pseudo-classes :
A pseudo-class is a selector that selects elements that are in a specific state, e.g. they are the first 
element of their type, or they are being hovered over by the mouse pointer. 

Pseudo-classes are keywords that start with a colon.For example, :link is a pseudo-class.
Types of Pseudo-Classes
There are the following types of pseudo-classes in CSS:

Structural pseudo-class: Selects elements based on their position in document such as :first-child, 
:last-child, etc.
Link pseudo-class: Selects the links based on their state such as :link, :visited, etc.
UI pseudo-class: Selects the form elements based on their state such as :enabled, :disabled, etc.

Structural Pseudo-Classes
Structural pseudo-class selects elements based on their position in the document. There are following 
structural pseudo-classes.

CSS first-child Pseudo-Class :
The first-child pseudo-class selector styles the first child of its parent element. 
Here's the syntax:-
selector : first-child {
  /* styles */
}

pseudo-class  :is
The :is pseudo-class takes a list of selector arguments and matches all elements that apply to any selector 
in the list. 

Here's the syntax:-
:is(selector1, selector2, selector3) {
  /* styles */
}

The CSS :has() pseudo-class is a relatively new feature that allows developers to select elements based on 
their children. It is a powerful tool for more specific and dynamic styling and can be used in conjunction 
with other pseudo-classes and selectors.

The :has() pseudo-class is used to select parent elements that contain specific child elements. This allows 
for conditional styling based on the presence or absence of certain children.

Syntax:
:has()
